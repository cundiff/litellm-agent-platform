/**
 * Cron-driven automations: scheduled triggers that spawn a session for an
 * agent on a recurring cadence.
 *
 * Two halves live here:
 *   - Cron helpers (validate / compute next fire) used by the API routes when
 *     a user creates or edits an automation. Schedules are 5-field cron
 *     evaluated in UTC.
 *   - `tickAutomations`, called every worker tick (see src/worker/index.ts),
 *     which claims due rows and fires their sessions.
 *
 * Multi-pod safety: claiming uses `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` inside a
 * transaction that also advances `next_run_at` to the next occurrence before
 * commit. Two pods ticking at the same instant can't double-fire — pod B's
 * SKIP LOCKED skips the row pod A holds, and once pod A commits the row's
 * next_run_at is in the future so it isn't re-claimed. Session bring-up (a
 * 30s+ cold spawn) runs *outside* the transaction so the row lock window stays
 * tiny.
